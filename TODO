Code cleanliness:
* make private TA methods actually private
* merge TA.value and TA.values by querying the GradeBook for values instead
* Target.value setter calls gradebook.registerQuestion() instead?
* separate collectors and reporters into separate objects within the TA?

Fixes:
* absolute position gives position relative to viewport. is that desired behavior?
* expand toEqual to match arrays and objects as well
* less janky way of hide/expand test results
* cssProperty creates a FSL
