## Description
This directory contains files needed to build the extension for Chromium based browsers (Google Chrome).

While the WebExtension API is well supported in Chromium, there still needs to be specific quirks.

## Prerequisites
To build the extension you first need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). The second step is to install the [Add-ons SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jpm). Using NPM, it can be installed as follow:

> npm install jpm --global

Further information for installing the Add-ons SDK can be found at the [official documentation.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tools/jpm#Installation).

## Building
